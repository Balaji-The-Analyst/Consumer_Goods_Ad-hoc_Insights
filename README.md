# Consumer Goods Ad-hoc Insights
Atliq Hardware (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and has expanded in other countries too.
However, the management noticed that they did not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both skills.

## Here are the questions I was interested in answering
1) Provide the list of markets in which customer "Atliq Exclusive" operates its business in the APAC region.
2) What is the percentage of unique product increase in 2021 vs. 2020?
3)  Provide a report with all the unique product counts for each segment and sort them in descending order of product counts.
4)  Which segment had the most increase in unique products in 2021 vs 2020?
5)  Get the products that have the highest and lowest manufacturing costs.
6)  Generate a report that contains the top 5 customers who received an average high pre_invoice_discount_pct for the fiscal year 2021 and in the Indian market.
7)  Get the complete report of the Gross sales amount for the customer “Atliq Exclusive” for each month. This analysis helps to get an idea of low and high-performing months and make strategic decisions.
8)  In which quarter of 2020, got the maximum total_sold_quantity?
9)  Which channel helped to bring more gross sales in the fiscal year 2021 and the percentage of contribution?
